# Introduction to Husky

In modern software development, code must be kept clean, consistent, and team-friendly. We developers always use linters, formatters, and test tools to ensure our code is clean and free of bugs. However, manually executing these tools every time prior to committing code can be laborious and easy to forget. That is where Husky comes in handy.

## What is Husky?

Husky is a heavy-duty open-source tool that makes it easy and efficient for developers to manage and automate Git hooks. Git hooks are scripts run by Git ahead of or following certain events, such as committing something or pushing to a repository. Husky makes it easier to integrate hooks like these into a project and execute them the same way with all developers working on a team.

With Husky, you can automate scripts to run at a number of points in your Git process. In other words, you can set tasks like linting, formatting, testing, or checking commit messages in advance before a commit will be accepted. If your code doesn't meet the requirements that you've established, then the commit will be halted from proceeding until those issues are resolved.

## Why Use Husky

Developers would need to remember to format or run linters prior to checking in code otherwise, and in the absence of applications like Husky. Inconsistent code quality would make builds fail or even push bugs into production. Husky maintains quality checks automatically at the appropriate places in your typical Git flow.

### Benefits of Using Husky:

- **Automation of routine tasks:** Format the code automatically, run the linters, or run the tests before each commit.
- **Prevent bad commits:** Don't commit non-passing code to your project's quality check.
- **Team-wide consistency:** Hold all team members in check through checks during Git operations.
- **Better collaboration:** Makes collaborating on projects easier by reducing code conflicts and enforcing good commit practices.

## How Does Husky Work

Husky hooks into Git events like `pre-commit`, `pre-push`, `commit-msg`, etc., and runs predefined commands at these events. For example, if you want to format your code correctly before every commit, you can tell Husky to run a formatter like Prettier at the `pre-commit` hook. If the code is not formatted properly, the commit will be prevented until it is fixed.

### Supported Git Hooks:

- **pre-commit:** Runs before a commit is finished. Ideal for code linting or formatting.
- **commit-msg:** Runs after entering the commit message. Can be used to enforce commit message rules.
- **pre-push:** Runs before code is pushed to a remote repository. Handy for running tests or final checks.

Rather than typing these shell scripts for these kinds of hooks manually, Husky lets you express them in a clean and readable manner. That's more attractive to developers, and easier to handle on projects.

## Real-World Use Cases

Let's say you are in a team and someone forgets to use the linter or formatter. They commit code with style issues or even bugs. Someone else pulls that code later, and now the issue has spread. Husky completely prevents this. As soon as someone tries to commit, Husky will execute the specified checks automatically, and if code fails, it will not commit until it's fixed.

This form of automation not just saves time but also improves the quality of the codebase as a whole.

## Conclusion

Husky is a highly useful tool that helps you incorporate quality assurance into your development process. Using Git hooks, it ensures that the code entering your project is up to the expected standards and that all contributors have consistent practices.

It’s especially valuable in team environments where maintaining clean, uniform code is essential. Instead of relying on memory or individual discipline, Husky automates these checks and makes them part of your workflow. Whether you’re working alone or with a large team, Husky helps enforce best practices effortlessly.

If you are newly starting out on automating Git, learning Husky is a great place to start. It's simple to understand, easy to apply, and very good at keeping your project tidy and professional.
